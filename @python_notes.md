## Slicing a list
- To output the first three elements in a list, you would request indices 0 through 3, which would return elements 0,1,2.
```
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[0:3])
```
- If you omit the first index in a slice, Python automatically starts your slice at the beginning of the list:
```
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[:4])
```
- Similar syntax if you omit the second index:
```
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[2:])
```
*Advantage: you don't need to know the length of the list.*

- If you need a slice of list for last three of a list, do like following:
```
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
print(players[-3:])
```
## Copying a list using a slice
```
friend_foods = my_foods[:] -> 1
friend_foods = my_foods -> 2
```
**Case 1 does not equal to Case 2.**

	Case 1: Both lists are independent, only copied items at this moment are the same. Any item added to one of these lists only, then the two lists are different.
	
	Case 2: Both lists are identical **all the time**!
## Tuple
An immutable list is called a *tuple*.

## PEP8
- PEP8 recommends that you use four spaces per indentation level. TABs and SPACEs must not be mixed used otherwise they are very difficult to diagnose.

##Checking That a List Is NOT Empty
```
requested_toppings = []

if requested_toppings:
    for requested_topping in requested_toppings:
        if requested_topping == 'green peppers':
            print("Sorry, we are out of green peppers right now.")
        else:
            print("Adding %s." % requested_topping)
else:
    print("Are you sure you want a plain pizza?")
```
As shown in above example, when the name of a list is used in an **if** statement, Python returns **True** if the list contains at least one item; an empty list evaluates to **False**.

# Dictionaries
*A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs.*
- In Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces,{}, with a series of key-value pairs inside the braces, e.g.
```
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
```
- You can have unlimited number of key-value pairs in a dictionary.
- Dictionaries are dynamic structures. You can add new key-value pairs at any time.
- Python does NOT care the order of the key-value pairs!

## A Dictionary of Similar Objects
Herewith an example:
```
favorite_languages = {
        'jen':'python',
        'sarah': 'c',
        'edward': 'ruby',
        'phil': 'python',
        }
```
**Note: the last colma could be omitted.**

# Looping Through a Dictionary
## Looping Through All Key-Value Pairs
```
for key, value in user_0.items()::
	print("\nKey: " + key)
	print("Value: " + value)
```
The variable *key* and *value* can also be named with other names as you like, e.g.
```
for k,v in user_0.items()
```

## Looping through All the keys in a Dictionary
See in this example:
```
for name in favorite_numbers.keys():
    print(name.title())
```
**Looping through the keys is default!**
You can also write above code like this:
```
for name in favorite_languages:
```

## Looping Through a Dictionary's Keys in Order
*sorted()* function must be used.

## Looping Through All Values in a Dictionary
By using *values()* method, you can get a list of values without any keys. Repeats might exist.
In order to get rid of repeats, *set()* function must be used.

# Nesting
- a list of dictionaries

# Input() function
- If a prompt is too long, save it in a variable.
```
prompt = "If you tell us who you are, we can personalize the mesages you see."
prompt += "\nWhat is your first name? "

name = input(prompt)
print("Hello, %s!" % name.title())
```
- Return value of *input()* function is a string!
- When you use numerical input to do calculations and comparisons, be sure to convert the input value to a numerical representation first.
- If you're using Python 2.7, use *raw_input()* instead of *input()*.

# While Loops
A *while* loop runs as long as, or *while*, a certain condition is true.

## Using a Flag
- If many possible events might occur to stop the program, trying to test all these conditions in one *while* statement becomes complicated and difficult.
- We can write our programs so they run while the *flag* is set to *True* and stop running when any of several events sets the value of the *flag* to False. 
``` 
active = True
while active:
    message = input(prompt)

    if message == 'quit':
        active = False
    else:
        print(message)
```
## Using break to Exit a loop
- This is another way to exit a loop.
- You can use the *break* statement in any of Python's loops.

## Using continue in a Loop
- You can use the *continue* statement to return to the beginning of the loop, based on the result of a conditional test.
- In case of an infinite loop, press *CTRL+C* to exit the loop. 

## Using a while loop with Lists and Dictionaries
- You shouldn't modify a list inside a *for* loop because Python will have trouble keeping track of the items in the list.
- To modify a list as you work through it, use a *while* loop.
```
# Start with users that need to be verified,
# and an empty list to hold confirmed users.
unconfirmed_users = ['alice', 'brian', 'candace']
confirmed_users = []

# Verify each user until there are no more unconfirmed users.
# Move each verified user into the list of confirmed users.
while unconfirmed_users:
    current_user = unconfirmed_users.pop(0)

    print("Verifiying user: %s" % current_user.title())
    confirmed_users.append(current_user)

# Display all confirmed users.
print("\nThe following users have been confirmed:")
for confirmed_user in confirmed_users:
    print(confirmed_user.title())

print(unconfirmed_users)
print(confirmed_users)
```
- The *while* loop runs as long as the list *unconfirmed_users* is not empty.

### *remove()*, *del()*, *pop()*
- *remove()* and *pop()* are methods; *del()* is a function
- *remove()* takes values as inputs; *pop()* takes index as inputs

### Removing All Instances of Specific Values from a List
```
pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'cat']
print(pets)

while 'cat' in pets:
    pets.remove('cat')

print(pets)
```
- After printing the list, Python enters the while loop because it finds the value 'cat' in the list at least once. 
- Once inside the loop, Python removes the first instance of 'cat', returns to the while line, and then reenters the loop when it finds that 'cat' is still in the list. 

# Function
## Defining a function
```
def greet_user():
    """Display a simple greeting."""
    print("Hello!")

greet_user()
```
- Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes, which Python looks for when it generates documentation for the functions in your programs.

## Arguments and Parameters
```
def greet_user(username):
    """Display a simple greeting."""
print("Hello, " + username.title() + "!") greet_user('jesse')
```
- 'username' inside the parentheses is called *parameter*
- when calling the function, people will give a value to 'username' e.g. 'jesse'. 'jesse' is called an argument.

## Passing Arguments
- positional arguments
- keyword arguments: the order doesn't matter

## Default Values
When you use default values, any parameter with a default value needs to be listed after all the parameters that donâ€™t have default values. 

## Passing a List
- Parameter of a function could be a list which will be passed to a function.
- When you pass a list to a function, the function can modify the list.
- Any changes made to the list inside the function's body are permenent.
- Every function should have one specific job.
- If you need to preserve the original list, you should pass a copy of the original list to the function when calling.
```
print_models(unprinted_designs[:], completed_models)
```

## Passing an Arbitrary Number of Arguments
Python packs the arguments into a tuple, even if the function receives only one value.
```
('pepperoni',)
('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```
## Mixing Positional and Arbitrary Arguments
The parameter that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments must be placed last in the function definition.
```
def make_pizza(size, *toppings):
	"""Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""
	print("\nMaking a " + str(size) + 
	"-inch pizza with the following toppings:")
	for topping in toppings: print("- " + topping)

make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```
## Storing Your Functions in Modules
- You can store your functions in a seperate file called a *module* and then *importing* that module into your main program.
- The best approach is to import the function or functions you want, or import the entire module and use the dot notation.

## Styling Functions
- Functions should have descriptive names, and these names should use lowercase letters and underscores.
- Every function should have a comment that explains concisely what the function does using the dotstring format.
- If you speficy a default value for a parameter, no spaces should be used on either side of the equal sign:
 ```
 def function_name(parameter_0, parameter_1='default value')
 ```
 - The same convention should be used for keyword arguments in function calls:
 ```
 function_name(value_0, parameter_1='value')
 ```
- If your program or module has more than one function, you can sepa- rate each by two blank lines to make it easier to see where one function ends and the next one begins.

# Classes
In object-oriented programming you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these classes. 
- By convention, capitalized names refer to classes in Python.
- The *__init__()* method is a special method Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance
- The self parameter is required in the method definition
- When you create a class in Python 2.7, you need to make one minor change. You include the term object in parentheses when you create a class

## Inheritance
- When one class *inherits* from another, it automatically takes on all the attributes and methods of the first class. 
- The original class is called the *parent class*, and the new class is the *child* class.
- Child class is also free to define new attributes and methods of its own.
- When you create a child class, the parent class must be part of the current file and must appear before the child class in the file.
- The name of the parent class must be included in parentheses in the definition of the child class.

## Overriding Methods from the Parent Class
- You can define a method in the child class with the same name as the method you want to override in the parent class.
- Python will disregard the parent class method and only pay attention to the method you define in the child class.
- When you use inheritance, you can make your child classes retain what you need and override anything you donâ€™t need from the parent class.
- You import multiple classes from a module by separating each class with a comma

## Styling Classes
- Class names should be written in *CamelCapsl*: capitalize the first letter of each word in the name, and don't use underscores.
- Within a class, you can use one blank line between methods, and within a module you can use two blank lines to seperate classes.
- Import of modules: first, standard modules; then add a blank line and the import statements for the module you wrote.

# Files
## Reading from a File
```
with open('pi_digits.txt') as file_object: 
	contents = file_object.read() 
	print(content)
```
- The keyword *with* closes the file once access to it.
- Python will close the file automatically when the time is right.
- *read()* returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file
- If you want to remove the extra blank line, you can use *rstrip()* in the print statement

## Writing to a File
- in *open()* function, you define the second argument: read mode('r'), write mode('w'), append mode('a'), read and write mode('r+')
- The *open()* function automatically creates the file you're writing to if it doesn't already exist.
- Be carful with write mode: if the file does exist, Python will erase the file before returning the file object.
- Python can only write strings to a text file. If you want to store numerical data in a text file, you'll have to convert the data to string format first using the *str()* function.
